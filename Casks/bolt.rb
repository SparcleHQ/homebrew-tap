  # Bolt ships a Tauri updater and updates itself in place. Without this, Homebrew treats a
  # self-updated app as drift and `brew upgrade` reinstalls over it — two updaters fighting
  # over the same bundle, which is how a working install ends up half-replaced.

  # The bundle used to be called "Bolt Enterprise.app". Homebrew only knows how to remove the
  # artifact the INSTALLED cask declared, so on the upgrade that crosses the rename the old
  # bundle can be left in /Applications — a second, older Bolt that still auto-launches and
  # fights the new one over port 13018. Naming it here removes it. `trash:` rather than
  # `delete:`: the cookbook calls delete a last resort, and trashing is reversible and needs
  # no sudo. Drop this once no installed cask can still be on the old name.
